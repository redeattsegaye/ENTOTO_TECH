     HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — 
     there is no set order to do things in.Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. 
     They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
     HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.

        The "body" element contains the entire content of a webpage. 
         It must be the second element inside of the parent  "html"element, 
             following only the "head" element.

<h1>SQL Constraints</h1>
<p>SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
 If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted by the constraint.<p>
    
     <h1> NOT NULL Constraint</h1>
<p>The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a field to always contain a value. This means that you cannot insert a new record,
 or update a record without adding a value to this field.</p>

 <h1>UNIQUE Constraint</h1>
<p>The UNIQUE constraint uniquely identifies each record in a database table.
The UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints both provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint defined on it.</p>
